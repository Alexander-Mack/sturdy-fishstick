This repository will be a collection of assorted projects that I have worked on for my own personal use. If you like any of this please feel free to use it just make sure to credit me if you make it big!

# Sarcasminator.cpp
This program takes a string from the user and converts it into a "sarcastic" version, where it outputs a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter, followed by a capital letter, etc, until it reaches the end of input. To which it then outputs to the standard output.

# botnet stuff
This folder has some (almost) working parts for a botnet made for psuedo DDOS attacks. For educational purposes only. This is going to be repurposed for a more legally sound purpose.
