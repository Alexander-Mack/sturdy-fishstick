This repository will be a collection of assorted projects that I have worked on for my own personal use. If you like any of this please feel free to use it just make sure to credit me if you make it big!

# Sarcasminator.cpp
This program takes a string from the user and converts it into a "sarcastic" version, where it outputs a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter, followed by a capital letter, etc, until it reaches the end of input. To which it then outputs to the standard output.

# botnet stuff
This folder has some (almost) working parts for a botnet made for psuedo DDOS attacks. For educational purposes only. This is going to be repurposed for a more legally sound purpose.

# IRC_Client
This folder contains the workings of a C# based IRC client, to be used in tandem with the IRC_Server. It has a GUI that accepts messages from the user, and receives messages from the server. It uses RSA and AES encryption to protect transmissions. The program is designed for Windows machines, using windows forms and some VB objects. Currently the IP address is incorrectly set for network safety, so that will need to be changed in order for the program to function.

# IRC_Server
This folder contains the workings of a C# based IRC server, to be used for the IRC_Client. This server accepts messages from users, and echoes them off to all other connected users. It uses RSA and AES encryption to protect the messages in transmission. It is designed to be run from the command line, and has been properly working on an Ubuntu 22.04 laptop. Currently the IP address is incorrectly set for network safety, so nothing will connect to the server unless that is changed.
