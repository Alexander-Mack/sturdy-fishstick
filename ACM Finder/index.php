        <h1>Welcome to ACM Finder!</h1>
        <p style="margin: auto 30px auto auto;">Here at ACM Finder
            we endeavor to provide you with the contacts
            necessary to keep your business running smoothly.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 100px auto auto 30px;">Made by fabricators,
            for fabricators, any time that you're
            short a couple panels, it can be stressful to find them
            on short

            notice for a reasonable price.</p>
        <p style="margin: 100px 30px auto auto;">As well, we
            understand the push and pull of storing a couple extra
            panels leftover from a job, with the hope of either
            finding a use for them, or selling them to a competitor.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 100px auto auto 30px;">So ACM Finder is
            here to bring both sides together, creating a virtual
            marketplace for businesses to fill orders in a pinch
            affordably, and offload extra material quickly.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 100px 30px auto auto;">When fabricators or
            suppliers upload their inventory to ACM Finder,
            it is displayed to potential buyers from all across
            Canada, who will search for panels to suit their needs.
